# LinkedListChallenge

This was a challenge to utilize abstract classes, interfaces, and other concepts to make my own version of a linked list using my own 
Abstract node class and a Grocerylist(Linked List) class to alphabetize the groceries in the list as they are added. I know there are easier ways to 
implement this but the challenge was to do it using these parameters.
